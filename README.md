# 5001-Kaggle

The .ipynb file contain model used for my kaggle competition.
The required programming language is python3.

Here are some of the libraries needed for this model:
numpy, tensorflow, pandas and sklearn.

The train .csv file was modified for preprocessing and some feature generation purpose on google sheet.
I have uploaded a copy here called "train - train.xlsx". The formula to generate the new features is in each cell.
Due to this reason, using new datasets to test this is possible, but would require some additional work.

In the future I will be sure to do prototyping and feature engineering in python environment as well.
